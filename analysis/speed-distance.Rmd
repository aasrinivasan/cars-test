```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Basic Calculations:
```{r}
head(cars)

# do some stats
meanSpeed = mean(cars$speed)
meanDist = mean(cars$dist)
```

### Basic Plots:

```{r}
reg = lm(dist~speed, data = cars)
plot(cars$dist~cars$speed, pch = 16, main="Stopping Dist vs Speed")
# Add the regression line
abline(reg)
```

Here is my amazing conclusion. As your speed increases, your stopping didstance increases!

Don't speed.
